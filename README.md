--- Abstract ---

This project is a part of a bigger academic project that aimed at designing a GPS-based navigation system in augmented reality.
The goal of this part is to build and implement a Computer Vision algorithm to detect the road in an image captured by a camera located on the windshield of a car in motion.

I implemented a testbench that provided me with a tool to implement, test and optimize a sequence of filters and treatments that extract information from the image.
The final results were quite promising as you may see on the screenshots at the end of report-fr.pdf, but the algorithm is still quite unstable and sensitive to brutal changes in the road's shape, and much too long to be run in real time.


--- Languages ---

The project was implemented in C++, using Qt to build the UI and OpenCV for the image processing.
